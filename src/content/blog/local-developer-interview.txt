Diskit shared how she started contributing documentation fixes to upstream repos, slowly moving into Rust tooling and localization projects. Her main advice: keep a public learning log and do small, consistent contributions to earn trust.

We also discussed the challenges of working with low bandwidth. Diskit mirrors repos locally during town visits and syncs patches via email when needed. Her story is a reminder that infrastructure limits cannot block determined contributors.

We spent an afternoon demystifying Git internals—covering commits as content-addressed snapshots, branching strategies, and practical rebasing. Participants practiced on a shared "ladakh-trails" repository, solving merge conflicts that mirrored real-world collaboration.

All demos plus extra exercises live inside the Community Resources archive. You will also find a printable cheat-sheet for offline reference during treks or field work where connectivity is unreliable.

Localization is more than translating strings; it means expanding Unicode ranges, creating font stacks, and validating text input flows. Our language pack project now ships keyboard layouts for the three most common dialects plus script-conversion utilities for archival content.

The repo includes reproducible build scripts, so schools can generate updated bundles without special tooling. Next on the roadmap is spell-checker integration and testing on Android-based devices used across Ladakh.

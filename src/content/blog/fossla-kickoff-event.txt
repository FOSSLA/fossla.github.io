Over fifty students, engineers, and educators joined us at Leh Community Center for the very first FOSS LA meetup. We installed Linux on ten laptops, ran lightning talks on self-hosting, and demoed two active projects. The energy in the room proved there is demand for a consistent open source community in the Himalayas.

Our next steps include monthly hack nights, a mentorship roster, and a shared Matrix space. If you missed the kickoff you can still grab the slides, recordings, and starter issues inside the Resources section of this site.
